Download and import the database sql file after extracting.

CRUD (Create, Read, Update & Delete) functions where implemented and permissions were assigned to different roles. 

The role determines what each user can do. (e.g)-> SUper admin can perform all crud functions, where guest (role) can only view, but cannot create new role. 
Also, user can add,edit, view & delete.

Also, Users can be searched through the search bar. and logout is on the sidebar.
